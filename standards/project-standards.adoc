= Git

== Location and Naming

The Nerdery SHALL use git, specifically BitBucket Server for all projects unless otherwise
requested by a client. Projects MUST be placed under the client they are for
and project names MUST be written in the form of `mobile.{appName}.android`
(all lower case) or if a library project `mobile.library.android.{libraryName}`.
For example, the Hy-Vee flagship application is named `mobile.flagship.android`.
This convention is in place so there is not confusion among the many projects
that can be listed under a client in BitBucket.

== Branching

Android projects will use git-flow style of branching and merging. Checkout
https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow[Atlassian's Documentation]
and this http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/[helpful guide]
for more information. The default branch in Bitbucket MUST be set to develop
to avoid confusion on which branch to work off of.

To get a feature or hotfix branch merged into the develop branch a pull
request SHALL be created through the BitBucket UI and be reviewed by at least
one other developer. The reviewer SHOULD be the lead developer unless the
lead developer delegates this task out to other team members. Consult with your
lead for guidance on how they would like the review process to go.

In addition to having a review, the branch MUST pass a merge build from
<<Continuous Integration>>. This is a build that confirms that the code once
merged into master will not break the build.

== Forking

Although not required, it is RECOMMENDED to fork repositories under your user
account. This prevents clutter and reduces the work of figuring out which
branches can and should be deleted. Under your own fork, you are in charge of
all the branches and can delete and save them as you see fit.

IMPORTANT: If using a fork you MUST set the 'Repository Permissions' to allow
the *Production Group* to read. This allows any developer to access and see what
you are working on. Just in case you forget to create a PR before you go on
vacation.

== Releases

NOTE: A release is defined as the code that is currently or soon to be in the
Play Store.

All release builds MUST be tagged. The proper format for a tag would be
`v{major}.{minor}.{patch}`.

TIP: Don't forget to push the tags to the remote (BitBucket).

An example would be:
```
git tag -a v1.0.0 # -a is not required but RECOMMENDED
git push origin v1.0.0
```

It is REQUIRED that before creating a release, a release branch is made,
so that bug fixes can be merged into the release branch while new features can
be included in master. The release branch name MUST be in the following form,
`release-{major}.{minor}.{patch}`. The release branch SHOULD be merged into
`master` once the code has been pushed to the play store.

== Commit History

=== Commit Message

We will follow http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/['The seven rules of a great Git commit message']
when creating commit messages. They are as follows.

. Separate subject from body with a blank line
. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
. Capitalize the subject line
. Do not end the subject line with a period
. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
. Wrap the body at 72 characters
. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

=== Clean History

To keep a clean commit history, which makes reviewing pull requests, and
rewinding code a easier process, commits on branches SHOULD be complete,
that is buildable, as well as follow The Seven Rules described above. The RECOMMENDED
solution to achieve this is to use the `--amend` flag for committing when
making multiple edits to a branch or where many commits have already been made
during the development process use rebase command to re-write history.

= README

Every project MUST have a README file. The README MUST be a text file, this
file MAY use a markup language as long as it is easy to read without the use
of a text processor. For example; plain text (.txt),
https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/markdown-syntax-guide-776639995.html[markdown] (.md), or
http://asciidoctor.org/[asciidoctor] (.adoc) would all be fine choices.

The README should contain all information possible about the project. It should
be the source of truth that will allow a developer to easily find anything
they need to know about the project. This should include but is not limited to
links to JIRA, git, Buddy Build, documentation on how to set up the project,
and how to release the project.

The following README template SHOULD be used for projects.

[README.md]
```
# Project Name

## Important Project links

<!--
Place important project links here, anything and everything that is related to
this project should be documented here.

## Build Types
<!--
Give each build variant/flavor a different section here. Explain what each
does, why one would use it, what features each has, links to associated
services (ie. crashlytics, firebase), which should be given to clients, and what
signing keys are used.
-->

## Project Setup
<!--
Describe step by step setup and any dependencies that are required and
their setup as well.
-->

## In Scope Devices
<!--
List out devices that are in scope here.
-->

## Contributing
<!--
Include any special requirements for contributing to the project. Are there
special style guides that must be followed? Is there a different flow for
doing pull requests. Anything else that might be relevant for contributing.
-->
```

NOTE: The above is a guideline for creating a good README, but anything that
is thought to be useful in a README should be included. Anything about a project
that differs from standard operating procedure SHOULD be documented in the
README.

= Testing

== Unit Testing

Unit Tests SHOULD be implemented for all code that does not have direct dependencies
on `android` packages and does some amount of work. That is any code
that is not in the views, fragments or activities, should be tested.
Not having the time to unit test is not a valid excuse for not testing. Time
is always saved in the long run when testing.

== UI Tests / Functional / Instrumentation Tests

All of these types of testing are RECOMMENDED, but should be considered on a
case by case basis to see if they fit for the project.

= Continuous Integration

All Android Projects at The Nerdery MUST use CI.
https://dashboard.buddybuild.com[Buddybuild] is a quick and
convenient way to set this up with our BitBucket Server.

== Setting Up Buddybuild

. Create a ticket to http://nrdry.com/sisreq[SIS] to allow
Buddybuild to see your project. Buddybuild
can not see projects by default to ensure our client's privacy. Projects with
specific security requirements may not be able to use Buddybuild. Check
with your project lead or project manager to ensure that you may use Buddybuild.
. While you are waiting for your project to be exposed to Buddybuild follow
these directions to get your
http://docs.buddybuild.com/docs/connect-with-bitbucket-server[BitBucket Account integrated]
with Buddybuild.
. Once your project is visible to Buddybuild, follow
http://docs.buddybuild.com/docs/selecting-an-app[these steps] to get
your project setup and building.

NOTE: It is RECOMMENDED to let Buddybuild handle the building of your release
APKs and managing version numbers. This avoids confusion and ensures a single
place where every build will be built in the exact same way.

= Logging

Logging is very important in be able to quickly debug applications. For this
the reason The Nerdery Android Developers have adopted
https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber[Timber] as the logger of choice.
Timber allows to quickly log values to different streams instead of just logcat.
Timber also allows for the type of logging to be easily switched from build
type to build type.

The Nerdery SHOULD use Timber in all new projects and is RECOMMENDED to be used
in legacy projects when the legacy project does not have a logging alternative
to logcat.

Release builds MUST NOT log to logcat. This is a security concern as well as a
performance issue. Logs SHOULD instead be sent to Crashlytics, Google Analytics,
Firebase, Loggy, or some other comparable cloud logging option where they can
be reviewed and used to debug issues.
